					<h2>Our Services</h2>
					<p class="para2">Our gas leak detection service is based on thermal imaging technology, which uses infrared cameras to capture images of the surrounding area. These cameras are capable of detecting temperature differences in the environment, making it possible to identify any hotspots that could indicate a gas leak.</p>
					<p class="para2">Our team of trained professionals will conduct a thorough inspection of your facility using our thermal imaging technology, looking for any signs of a gas leak. If a leak is detected, we will provide you with a detailed report outlining the location and severity of the leak, along with recommendations for corrective action.</p>

					<h2>Data-Set</h2>
					<p class="para2">A thermal image (thermogram) is a digital representation of a scene and a measure of the thermal radiation emitted by the pictured objects.</p>
					<p class="para2">Thermal images are captured via thermographic cameras, which are devices capable of sensing this radiation in the form of infrared light. A thermal image allows us to remotely sense the temperature of an object or at least accurately tell its temperature relative to its environment.</p>
